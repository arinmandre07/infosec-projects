# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment – Public Database Server

> 📌 **Cybersecurity Portfolio Project**  
> Qualitative vulnerability assessment for a publicly exposed database system.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project documents a **vulnerability assessment** conducted for a fictional e-commerce company as part of a cybersecurity portfolio activity. The assessment focuses on identifying and evaluating security risks associated with a **publicly accessible remote database server**.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze how the exposed server impacts business operations, assess potential threats and risks, and propose **remediation and mitigation strategies** to reduce the organization’s overall security risk.

The company relies on a remote database server to support employees working from multiple locations worldwide. Because the server has been publicly accessible since launch, it presents a serious security vulnerability that could compromise sensitive business and customer data.

## 🎯 Assessment Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities related to a publicly exposed database server  
- Evaluate potential threat sources and threat events  
- Assess likelihood and severity of identified risks  
- Communicate security risks clearly to business stakeholders  
- Propose remediation and mitigation strategies to protect operations  

---

## 🧩 Scope of the Assessment

This vulnerability assessment focuses on:

- 🔐 Confidentiality of data stored on the database server  
- 🧾 Integrity of business and customer information  
- ⚙️ Availability of systems critical to business operations  

Physical security controls and unrelated infrastructure components are considered **out of scope** for this assessment.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment Approach

This assessment follows a **qualitative risk assessment approach**, guided by principles from **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**. Threat sources and threat events were identified and evaluated based on their potential likelihood and impact on business operations.

Each risk was assigned a **likelihood score** and **severity score** to determine overall risk levels and help prioritize remediation efforts.

---

## 🔐 Remediation and Mitigation Strategy

Based on the identified risks, remediation efforts focus on **reducing the attack surface** and **strengthening access controls**. Recommended security measures include restricting public access to the database server, applying the **principle of least privilege**, and enforcing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

Additional mitigation strategies include implementing **defense-in-depth controls**, improving authorization mechanisms, and enabling monitoring and logging to detect unauthorized access attempts.
