# 📓 Incident Handler’s Journal 

> Documenting incident investigations, tool usage, and professional reflections.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project contains my finalized **Incident Handler’s Journal**, developed throughout the course to document incident investigations, hands-on lab activities, and cybersecurity tools used in real-world scenarios.

The journal demonstrates my ability to record technical findings clearly, apply structured investigation techniques, and reflect on my learning progress. These entries showcase practical incident response skills and professional documentation practices that are essential for cybersecurity roles.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Document real-world style incident investigations using structured methodology  
- Apply the **5 W’s framework** (Who, What, When, Where, Why) during incident analysis  
- Record hands-on experience using cybersecurity tools  
- Practice accurate and professional security documentation  
- Reflect on learning progress and skill development  

---

## 🧩 Journal Structure

The incident handler’s journal includes:

- 🗓️ At least **four dated and numbered journal entries**  
- 🕵️ Two entries documenting **incident investigations using the 5 W’s**  
- 🛠️ Two entries describing **cybersecurity tools and their usage**  
- ✍️ Clear descriptions summarizing each entry  
- 📚 A reflections section capturing learning outcomes and challenges  

Each entry follows a consistent format for clarity and traceability.

## 🔍 Incident Investigation Entries

The incident-focused entries document:
- Security events analyzed during labs  
- Observations and evidence collected  
- Root cause analysis using the 5 W’s  
- Mapping to phases of the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**  
- Lessons learned from each investigation  

These entries demonstrate analytical thinking and structured problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Tool-Based Entries

The tool-focused entries capture hands-on experience using:
- Network traffic analysis tools  
- Log analysis platforms  
- Threat investigation utilities  
- Incident response workflows  

Each entry explains how the tool was used, what data was analyzed, and what insights were gained.

## 🧠 Reflections and Learning Outcomes

The reflections section includes short responses addressing:
- Challenges encountered during labs  
- Growth in understanding incident detection and response  
- Tools and concepts that were most engaging or valuable  
- How the learning experience supports career readiness  

This section highlights continuous improvement and professional self-assessment.
