# 🌐 Network Analysis

> Hands-on analysis of network behavior, security hardening, attack investigation, and incident reporting.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This folder contains a collection of practical network security activities focused on analyzing network behavior, identifying threats, applying hardening techniques, and evaluating incidents using industry standards.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world cybersecurity skills related to **network traffic analysis, system hardening, threat detection, and security reporting**. Each subfolder represents a focused activity completed during hands-on labs and simulations.

These exercises build a strong foundation for understanding how modern networks operate and how attackers exploit vulnerabilities — as well as how defenders detect and mitigate these risks.
